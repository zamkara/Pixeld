# PixelD

## üåê Abstract

PixelDrain is a fast and privacy-friendly file sharing service. `pixeld` wraps around its API to allow developers and command-line users to quickly interact with their PixelDrain account without relying on a graphical interface. Built for speed and simplicity, `pixeld` supports multi-file operations.

```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc # or source ~/.zshrc
```

### Fish:

set -Ux PIXEL_API_KEY your_api_key_here
```

To remove:

```fish

```
